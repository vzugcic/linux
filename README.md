Configuration reminder
Last edited on Sunday, October 16th 2016

Arch based manjaro linux, XFCE desktop environment, mostly.

I will try to keep some configuration files for console based applications like Mutt, WeeChat, MOCP, Newsbeuter, Calcurse. Your suggestions are always welcome, thank you very much.
